  This project was designed to display some basic instructions when you create
  a new game.  Simply delete the following code and implement your own Init(),
  Update() and Draw() logic.

-- This this is an empty game, we will the following text. We combined two sets of fonts into
-- the default.font.png. Use uppercase for larger characters and lowercase for a smaller one.
local message = "EMPTY GAME\n\n\nThis is an empty game template. Press Esc to exit the game. \n\n\nVisit 'pixelvision8.com' to learn more about creating games from scratch."

-- The Init() method is part of the game's lifecycle and called a game starts. We are going to
-- use this method to configure background color, ScreenBufferChip and draw a text box.
function Init()

  -- Here we are manually changing the background color
  BackgroundColor(0)

  local display = Display()

  -- We are going to render the message in a box as tiles. To do this, we need to wrap the
  -- text, then split it into lines and draw each line.
  local wrap = WordWrap(message, (display.x / 8) - 2)
  local lines = SplitLines(wrap)
  local total = #lines
  local startY = ((display.y / 8) - 1) - total

  -- We want to render the text from the bottom of the screen so we offset it and loop backwards.
  for i = total, 1, - 1 do
    DrawText(lines[i], 1, startY + (i - 1), DrawMode.Tile, "large", 15)
  end

end

-- The Update() method is part of the game's life cycle. The engine calls Update() on every frame
-- before the Draw() method. It accepts one argument, timeDelta, which is the difference in
-- milliseconds since the last frame.
function Update(timeDelta)

  -- TODO add your own update logic here

end

-- The Draw() method is part of the game's life cycle. It is called after Update() and is where
-- all of our draw calls should go. We'll be using this to render sprites to the display.
function Draw()

  -- We can use the RedrawDisplay() method to clear the screen and redraw the tilemap in a
  -- single call.
  RedrawDisplay()

  -- TODO add your own draw logic here.

end

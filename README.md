# Pixel Vision 8 Source Code

Pixel Vision 8's core philosophy is to teach retro game development with streamlined workflows. PV8 is also a platform that standardizes 8-bit fantasy console limitations built on top of the open-source C# game engine based on MonoGame. This engine simply provides a standard set of APIs to create authentic-looking 8-bit games with modern programming languages and workflows. It also allows you to define specific limitations that alter the following properties:

* Memory and game size
* Color palettes
* System colors
* Colors per sprite
* Number of sprites on screen
* Scrolling tilemap
* and more

There are different ways to build and run Pixel Vision 8 games depending on your choice of language and skill level. The most common way is to use the commercial build of the fantasy console itself which you can download from [pixelvision8.com](https://pixelvision8.com) and write your games in Lua. For more advanced developers familiar with C#, Pixel Vision 8 can be compiled in Visual Studio by visiting the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/PixelVision8) as well. There you will find the two components which make up Pixel Vision 8: a Runner and Pixel Vision OS.

The platform was designed to be incredibly modular. This allows you to customize it to your own needs. While there are tools and a dedicated OS to help make games with, there is nothing stopping you from using your own external tools and workflows.
